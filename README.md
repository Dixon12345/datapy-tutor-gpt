# DataPy Tutor â€“ A Beginner-Friendly GPT for Learning Python

**DataPy Tutor** is a custom GPT designed to help beginners learn Python for data science in an interactive and structured way.

Instead of just explaining code, it automatically opens a code canvas where users can practice writing and running Python step by step. The assistant waits for you to type "Done" before continuing â€” making the learning experience feel more like a personal tutor session.

This project explores how prompt design can support hands-on learning using GPTs.
